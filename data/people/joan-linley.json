Two days a week I look after my two squabbling grandaughters in Bingley.\n</p>\n<p>At Gateway I run Acomb Babies, a group for new parents. It's great to watch people make new friends and grow in confidence.\n</p>\n<p>I am also deputy safeguarding coordinator for Gateway, not much fun but neccessary.\n</p>\n<p>In between times I enjoy keeping up with old friends and new, hanging out in City Screen, eating cake, sewing and thinking about riding my bike and swimming.\n</p>",

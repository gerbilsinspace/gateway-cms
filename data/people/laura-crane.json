We moved to York from London in August 2016; in London I worked for a Christian organisation called Youth for Christ. One of the things I love most about the youth at Gateway is First Friday Food, where once a month we cook and eat a meal together, as it combines two of the things I enjoy the most - food and chatting!\n</p>",

I am married to the amazing Pete Crane and we have three gorgeous children, Joel, Hope and Ethan. We have been part of the Gateway family since 2016. We love how welcoming and friendly everyone is and we have made some fantastic friends.\n\n<p>The young people at Gateway are awesome and itâ€™s a privilege to work with them and our fab team of volunteers. One of the things I love most about the youth work at Gateway is our weekends away, as we have a great opportunity to really get to know one another and do exciting activities like outward bounds and high ropes courses.",

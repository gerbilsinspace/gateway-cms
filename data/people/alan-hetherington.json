We first came to Gateway in 2016 and now head the Welcome Team. I am also on the Pastoral Visiting Team.\n</p>\n<p>During the week, I'm one of a small group of volunteers who drive the York Foodbank van. My other interests include gardening (we have a very large garden!), transport and travel, current affairs and lots of reading.\n</p>",

On a Sunday morning you will often find me chasing after them and helping in the Adventurers kids group.I also help with the coordination of Lifegroups, and along with Jamie also lead a Lifegroup of our own. I work part-time as an English as a foreign language teacher and look after my kids the rest of the time. I love meeting up with other mums and their little ones, cooking (and sharing it with others) and on the rare occasion when I have a bit of time to myself, reading a book or peruse recipes. <br>\n</p>",

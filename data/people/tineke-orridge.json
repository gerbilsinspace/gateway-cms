I met Derryck there, and we married and eventually moved to Zimbabwe, before coming to England and settling in Whitby. After a few years working with WEC International in Buckinghamshire, we moved to York, and joined Gateway. I spend one day a week working with Family Matters, and I am also involved with Friends International, maintaining our link with overseas students. I have 3 little grandsons, and that's brought a new and very welcome dimension to our lives.\n</p>",

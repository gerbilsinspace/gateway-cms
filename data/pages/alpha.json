Exploring topics such as “Is there more to life than this?” and “Who is Jesus?”\n\nEach week will involve watching a 20-25 minute presentation, followed by an online discussion via video call. Our next Alpha starts on Wednesday 29th April and runs for 7 weeks.\n\n[If you're interested in attending Alpha, sign up here.](https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/vigmsln3)",

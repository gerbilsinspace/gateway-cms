I'm married to Georgina and we have 3 grown up children and 4 grandchildren, who think my camera is a part of me!\n</p>\n<p>I work in York for Aviva, and spend a lot of my “spare” time running!  But I’m built for comfort, not for speed.  I’ve also got a practical streak, and have been known to do a bit of gardening and DIY.\n</p>",

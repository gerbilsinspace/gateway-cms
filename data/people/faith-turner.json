  "deck": "<p>I gave my life to Jesus as a child and have had many adventures with him ever since, and can't imagine an existence without Him. I am passionate about mission, both abroad and locally, and also building the local church where I love being involved in a variety of ways. I have fun helping and teaching the youth, as well as caring for people under the umbrella of \"Parish Nursing\"  and as part of the pastoral care team. I also oversee the Gateway Foodbank and am team leader of Oasis, Gateway's community for over 65s. <br>\n</p>\n<p>I am enjoying retirement after approx 45 years in NHS and loving the new opportunities for mission that God is giving me. I also love skiing, badminton, dabbling with my art class, and having coffee with friends.\n</p>",

I am a primary school teacher and enjoy the challenge that teaching 4 year olds brings! In Gateway, I also help Kate organise @ the 20’s-30’s social group, help lead our wonderful group of youth and can sometimes be found running the info point desk – if you are new to Gateway or have any questions come and say hi!\n</p>",

I am currently in the middle of training part time to become a GP and enjoy the mix of working and looking after my family. Within Gateway I lead a Lifegroup with my husband. On Sundays you might find me on the worship team or working with the older primary aged children. Midweek I also help with Gateway Toddlers and the Oasis cafe.\n</p>",

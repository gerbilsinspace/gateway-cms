At Gateway I have been leading a women’s life group (together with Louise Manning), and I also help with Alpha and teach the New Start course.  I am passionate about getting new Christians ‘planted’ in the church and about supporting persecuted Christians in other countries (by praying and writing them letters).  Otherwise I work full time as an administrator at York University and enjoy sewing, art, walking and vegetable gardening.</i>\n</p>",

I  work one day a week in the office, mainly with finances and stuff relating to the Centre. On Sundays I can sometimes  be found serving refreshments or manning the Info desk. I also work part time in a local college, and when I'm not doing any of the above  I enjoy reading, films and a good natter over a cuppa.\n</p>",

  "deck": "<p>Over the Bank Holiday weekend a bunch of us spent a wonderful weekend attending 'Devoted'.  The weather was 'mixed' to say the least and our shared meal <span class=\"aBn\"><span class=\"aQJ\">on Saturday</span></span> was under cover as torrential rain came to add to the general excitement!\n</p>\n<p>The worship led by Lou Fellingham and her band was amazing - spirit filled and prophetic. The day time seminars were thought provoking and inspirational, ranging from studies on Markâ€™s Gospel, workshops on marriage and parenting and an inspiring and challenging set of sessions about living Life in the Spirit.   <span class=\"aBn\"><span class=\"aQJ\">On Saturday</span></span> night we had some incredible teaching by Tope Koleoso and we learnt about the exciting work of Christ Central churches across the world.   The children also had a wonderful time encountering God and having fun in the high quality kids work.\n</p>\n<p>The whole weekend provided a great set of memories, a boost to our walks with God and a lot of food for thought.  Thank you to all who made it happen.\n</p>",

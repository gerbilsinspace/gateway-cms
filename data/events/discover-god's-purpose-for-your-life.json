This first session will give you a flavour of the rest of the course to help you decide if you would like to continue.\n</p>\n<p>Come to understand your unique set of personal values, consider how you 'fit' into the Kingdom of God, reflect on the things that drive you forward and the things that hold you back in life generally. By the end of the course, you WILL have a purpose.\n</p>\n<p>Sign up via the Gateway office or at the Sunday Info Point.\n</p>\n<p><i></i>\n</p>"

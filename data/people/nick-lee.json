I spent most of my career as an accountant in the charity sector, with a stint at Joseph Rowntree here in York. I'm now working on developing a smallholding and wildlife site, and we run a B&amp;B as well. If I could, I'd spend most days on the river just pottering about. We are privileged to lead a life group where we aim to learn together, hear from God and encourage and pray for each other.\n</p>",

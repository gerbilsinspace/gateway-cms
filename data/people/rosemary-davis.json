I can be found at the Oasis Cafe on a Friday morning serving tea and coffee with lots of chatter. I am also looking forward to being part of the welcome team. I love gardening, reading and knitting and in my spare time I'm usually doing one of these; though I can sometimes manage the reading and knitting together.\n</p>",

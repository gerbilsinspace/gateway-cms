As I'm a teacher by trade, I have a real passion for seeing the teachings of Jesus applied to our lives. You'll often see me at the front with my guitar, and I'm excited by the way God is moving through our worship of Him. When I'm not at Gateway, I'm usually cycling or hanging out with friends.\n</p>",

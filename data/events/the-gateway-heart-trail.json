Join us from 7th February and go on our trail to find them.\r \n\nSee how many hearts you can find using one of our maps on your daily walk or bike ride. Write down what the hearts tell you about love, and let us know what you discovered on our online form to receive a prize delivered to your house! All ages are welcome to participate and send in their answers for a prize - no one is too old or too young! (Prizes are by household so you only need one set of answers per household.)\n\nDownload your map at: <https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/bjmv2xrx>"

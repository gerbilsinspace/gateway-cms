I've been involved with the Fairtrade movement for a long time, and I also work with BookAid, collecting Bibles and Christian books for developing countries. The Food Bank and Friends International also occupy some of my time. And supporting Nottingham Forest (twice European champions) has been a preoccupation since childhood.\n</p>",

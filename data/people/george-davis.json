I have 2 grown-up daughters and 4 grandchildren.\nI play golf two or three times a week, weather permitting, and also fly on my\nflight simulator on my computer. Together with Rosemary I run the Oasis over\n60s café at Gateway on Friday mornings. My desire for those who come to Oasis\nis to see relationships develop and for them to experience the love of Jesus.  I am also part of the Gateway welcome team.\n\t<o:p></o:p>\n</p>",

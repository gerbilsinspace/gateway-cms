I have fun helping and teaching the youth, as well as caring for people under the umbrella of \"Parish Nursing\"  and as part of the pastoral care team. I also oversee the Gateway Foodbank and am team leader of Oasis, Gateway's community for over 65s.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<p>I am enjoying retirement after approx 45 years in NHS and loving the new opportunities to serve that God is giving me. I also love skiing, badminton, dabbling with my art class, and having coffee with friends.\n</p>",

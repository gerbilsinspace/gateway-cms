I work as the Centre Manager at Gateway, and take care of the finances of the Church, ably supported by Karen Donkin. This involves a wide variety of roles, tasks and interactions making for a busy, sometimes bizarre, but wonderful working life.  I am so grateful to have found such a sense of belonging and fulfilment as part of the Gateway Church family.\n</p>",

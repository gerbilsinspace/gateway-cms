Exploring topics such as 'Is there more to life than this?' and 'Who is Jesus?'.\n\n<p>Each week will involve watching a 20-25 minute presentation, followed by an online discussion via video call. \n\n<p>Our next Alpha starts on Tuesday 12th January 2021 at 7.30pm and runs for 7 weeks. \n\n<p>Sign up at <https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/wra4jopn>"

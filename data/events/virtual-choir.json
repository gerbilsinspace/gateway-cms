You'll join via Zoom and enjoy singing in the comfort of your own home. Microphones will be muted, so the only person everyone can hear is our choir leader Nicola. \r\n\nThe session will last approximately one hour with a break mid-way for refreshments and a chat. \r\n\n\rSign up [here](https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/gbiovi3r)."

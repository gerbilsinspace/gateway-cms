I have worked as a languages teacher, careers advisor and youth support worker.  I recently left a part-time post at York College and am excited about what new doors God will open for me.  Steven and I got married in 2000 and we have loved being part of Gateway and helping with the stewarding and welcome teams. I am also involved in CAP and Reflect.  In my free time I like to escape to the mountains or walk in the countryside to refresh.  As a people person, I also enjoy nothing better than to meet up with friends for a coffee and chat.",

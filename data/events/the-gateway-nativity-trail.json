Join us this December and go on our trail to find them.\n\nSee if you can find all the characters from one or more of our maps on your daily walk, bike ride, or even drive. Write down which numbered location the characters appear at, and fill in our online answer form to receive a prize delivered to your house! All ages are welcome to participate and send in their answers for a prize - no one is too old or too young! (Prizes are by household so you only need one set of answers per household.)\r\n\nYou might also like to record the words from each location to see if you can put the words together to create some well known Christmas verses (one verse per map).\n\nDownload your map at: <https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/bpupaiqv>"

We had a brilliant time and the young people threw themselves into everything we threw at them! From prayer walks to cleaning, from sharing testimonies and singing in public squares to praying with homeless people, it was so encouraging to see our young people put their faith into action and love and serve people.\n</p>\n<p>A particular highlight for me was seeing our team interact with a group of Roma gypsy children at a project we visited on two different days. When we first arrived the kids and our team were very unsure of one another, but by the end we had laughter, face-painting and piggy-back rides. Thank you so much to everyone who prayed for us and supported this trip financially - it really was of huge benefit to everyone involved.\n</p>",

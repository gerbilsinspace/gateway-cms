We have 5 grown up children between us &amp; at the moment 1 gorgeous granddaughter. We have lived in Acomb for over 6 years. We are both on the welcome team and we lead a Lifegroup on a Wednesday evening. For me this means orchestrating a group of people &amp; hearing what they have to say on living with God in their lives.\n</p>\n<p><u></u>\n</p>\n<p>I work from home but am happy to be interrupted if anyone wants to call for a cuppa. I love the sunshine &amp; I’m a fair-weather gardener. Watching the garden grow is my speciality!\n</p>",

I am also on the prayer and welcome teams.\r\n\n\rI have a passion for evangelism and this has taken me off to Malawi on around a dozen occasions, where along with a team of people we work with local churches to reach out to people who do not yet know Jesus.\r\n\nFamily is very important to me and I now have a number of grandchildren.",

Weâ€™ve lived in York since 1983 and have 3 grown up children - two sons and a daughter - and four grandchildren. I also get involved in various church-related activities alongside John in his role as elder.  I love to see people finding their place in Gateway and encouraged to use their gifts.  My hobbies include swimming, walking and opera and I love to travel.\n</p>",

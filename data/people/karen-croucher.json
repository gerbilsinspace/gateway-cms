For me this means orchestrating a group of people and hearing what they have to say on living with God in their lives. We like people in our group to participate, so you don't just listen to me talk. \r\n\n\rI am on the rota for the information point and we are both on the welcome team.\r\n\n\rWe have 5 grown up children between us and at the moment 3 gorgeous granddaughters & counting.  \n\nI work from home but am happy to be interrupted if anyone wants to call for a cuppa. I love the sunshine and I’m a fair-weather gardener. Watching the garden grow is my specialty!",

Then join us for our online Alpha starting Tuesday 12th January.\r\n\n\rAlpha is an opportunity for people to investigate the Christian faith for themselves. Alpha is really for anyone who's curious. Exploring topics such as \"Is there more to life than this?\" and \"Who is Jesus?\"\r\n\nEach week will involve watching a 20-25 minute presentation, followed by an online discussion via video call.\r\n\n\rMore details and sign up at: <https://gateway.churchsuite.co.uk/events/wra4jopn>"

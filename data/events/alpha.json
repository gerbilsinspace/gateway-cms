  "article": "Got questions about life? Eager to explore Christianity further? \n\nAlpha is an opportunity for people to investigate the Christian faith for themselves. It's relaxed, friendly and fun, with food, a short video talk and plenty of time for discussion and questions. \n\nAlpha is really for anyone who's curious. Exploring topics such as \"Is there more to life than this?\" and \"Who is Jesus?\"\n\nNext Alpha is over 6 consecutive Tuesdays starting 7th January, 7.15pm."

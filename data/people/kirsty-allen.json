I’ve worked for a Christian charity based in Bradford for over 10 years and am passionate about equipping and empowering the local church to turn faith into action and see lives transformed. There’s nothing better than family time, but when I get the chance to relax, you’ll find me watching property programs or curled up on the sofa with a cup of coffee and a good book.\n</p>",

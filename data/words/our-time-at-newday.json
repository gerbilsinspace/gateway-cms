Newday is a huge young people’s christian event, bringing around 6,000 people together from churches in the UK and in Europe, to engage with the word of God, worship together and either start their friendship or build their friendship with Jesus.\n</p>\n<p>However, I know Newday is so much more than this. Over the week friendships strengthen during; trips to get milkshakes, playing games together, working together in tasks such as preparing meals or washing up, having late night conversations and praying for one another. At Newday people have amazing encounters with God, including healing (physical and emotional) and experiences of being filled with the Holy Spirit.\n</p>\n<p>This year was my second year at Newday and I feel that I’ve learnt how to interpret the God’s word and apply it to my life, therefore developing my connection with God and with this, uncovering a little bit more of God’s plan for me.\n</p>",

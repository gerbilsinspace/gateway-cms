Alpha is really for anyone who's curious. Exploring topics such as \"Is there more to life than this?\" and \"Who is Jesus?\"\n\nEach week will involve watching a 20-25 minute presentation, followed by an online discussion via video call.\n\nSend us an email at office@gatewaychurch.co.uk to find out more.

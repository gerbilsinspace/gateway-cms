I help out at Gateway Toddlers on a Wednesday morning, with our Discoverers group on a Sunday and help to lead our 'Who Let The Dads Out?' group with my husband, which happens monthly on a Saturday. My daytime job (alongside being a mum) is as the Communications Officer for Acts 435 - an online direct needs charity. At the weekend we love spending time as a family, especially exploring Yorkshire!",

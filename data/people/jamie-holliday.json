I help with the coordination of Lifegroups, and along with Reni also lead a Lifegroup of our own. On Sunday mornings I'm often to be found helping the toddlers make a spectacular mess in the Discoverers group. I love sport and enjoy playing for a local cricket team. I work as an accountant, which is really interesting, no really. Wait, come back...\n</p>",

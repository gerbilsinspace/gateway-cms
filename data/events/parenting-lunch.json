Are you interested in supporting children and families develop in faith?\n\nJoin us for our parenting lunches after church on the second Sunday of each month.\n\nWe eat together, watch a short video to inspire us as we parent children in their faith, and share together ideas/epic fails/success stories of how God is and can use us to help our children grow in faith.\n\nWe are using brand new videos from Parenting for Faith to inspire us on our journey.\n\nBring some food to share. There will be toys and games available for children to play with (but please be aware that supervised childcare will not be provided and you will remain responsible for your own children).\n\nThese lunches are open to anyone who is interested in helping children and young people grow in their faith. We would especially love to see families coming along, whether you have done the Parenting for Faith course in the past or not â€“ these lunches are for all of you!\n"

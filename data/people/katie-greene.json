Ben and I run a Lifegroup together, and I help out at Gateway Toddlers on a Wednesday morning. At the moment I'm mainly a full-time Mum but I also work a few hours a week for Acts 435 - an online direct needs charity. At the weekend I love spending time as a family - baking, going on days out and relaxing!<br>\n</p>",
